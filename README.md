# CS50x
Progress in my CS50x class

Currently working on the Scratch editor

In Ghost Attack, I have built a basic "Stop the Boats" clone. 
The last thing I need is to figure out a way to get the ghost to spawn far away from the centre.

I can get it to appear anywhere between -260<x<260 and -260<y<260 but the trouble lies in that it can spawn at (0,0) for an instant life loss.
I need a way to generate random positive and negative numbers without hitting (0,0)

Finished the first lecture of week 1.

2 projects to work on. 1. Generating the Mario pyramids and 2. verifying the credit card numbers.
The verifying looks to be the more interesting of the two.

Starting the Mario Project
I know that I need a do while loop for getting input for the height of the pyramids. But since I haven't seen all the little lectures for week one yet, I have no idea about the syntax required and keep getting errors. And trying to get the Boolean expression to output False when given a height between 0 and 23 is also tricky. Will definitely need to be clever with that one.

No real progress today. Was busy with my last day at work.
