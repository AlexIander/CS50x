# CS50x
Progress in my CS50x class

Currently working on the Scratch editor

In Ghost Attack, I have built a basic "Stop the Boats" clone. 
The last thing I need is to figure out a way to get the ghost to spawn far away from the centre.

I can get it to appear anywhere between -260<x<260 and -260<y<260 but the trouble lies in that it can spawn at (0,0) for an instant life loss.
I need a way to generate random positive and negative numbers without hitting (0,0)

Finished the first lecture of week 1.

2 projects to work on. 1. Generating the Mario pyramids and 2. verifying the credit card numbers.
The verifying looks to be the more interesting of the two.
